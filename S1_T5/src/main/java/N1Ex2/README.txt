Open a terminal or command prompt in your operating system.

1 - Type "cd" + the path to the content root. For example:
cd "directory_path"

2 - Compile the files:
javac RecursiveDirectory.java App.java

3 - Execute the app providing the directory path directly as a command-line argument:
java App "directory_path"

The Program will showcase the content of the directory alphabetically and, the content of any folder if there's any.
It will also indicate whether it's a directory or a file.
